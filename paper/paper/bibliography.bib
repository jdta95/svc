	abstract = {The adaptive Metropolis ({AM}) algorithm of Haario, Saksman and Tamminen (Bernoulli 7(2):223â€“242, 2001) uses the estimated covariance of the target distribution in the proposal distribution. This paper introduces a new robust adaptive Metropolis algorithm estimating the shape of the target distribution and simultaneously coercing the acceptance rate. The adaptation rule is computationally simple adding no extra cost compared with the {AM} algorithm. The adaptation strategy can be seen as a multidimensional extension of the previously proposed method adapting the scale of the proposal distribution in order to attain a given acceptance rate. The empirical results show promising behaviour of the new algorithm in an example with Student target distribution having no finite second moment, where the {AM} covariance estimate is unstable. In the examples with finite second moments, the performance of the new approach seems to be competitive with the {AM} algorithm combined with scale adaptation.},

	abstract = {Summary
            With scientific data available at geocoded locations, investigators are increasingly turning to spatial process models for carrying out statistical inference. Over the last decade, hierarchical models implemented through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods have become especially popular for spatial modelling, given their flexibility and power to fit models that would be infeasible with classical methods as well as their avoidance of possibly inappropriate asymptotics. However, fitting hierarchical spatial models often involves expensive matrix decompositions whose computational complexity increases in cubic order with the number of spatial locations, rendering such models infeasible for large spatial data sets. This computational burden is exacerbated in multivariate settings with several spatially dependent response variables. It is also aggravated when data are collected at frequent time points and spatiotemporal process models are used. With regard to this challenge, our contribution is to work with what we call predictive process models for spatial and spatiotemporal data. Every spatial (or spatiotemporal) process induces a predictive process model (in fact, arbitrarily many of them). The latter models project process realizations of the former to a lower dimensional subspace, thereby reducing the computational burden. Hence, we achieve the flexibility to accommodate non-stationary, non-Gaussian, possibly multivariate, possibly spatiotemporal processes in the context of large data sets. We discuss attractive theoretical properties of these predictive processes. We also provide a computational template encompassing these diverse settings. Finally, we illustrate the approach with simulated and real data sets.},

	abstract = {Land surface temperature and emissivity ({LST}\&E) are essential parameters for a wide range of studies undertaken at a variety of spatial scales. {LST}\&E products are generated by a number of spaceborne sensors such as {ASTER}, {MODIS}, and {AIRS} at varying spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions. We have developed an approach for producing gridded, mean, seasonal {ASTER} {LST}\&E Datasets at a spatial resolution of 100 m at nadir. This paper shows a mean wintertime and summertime emissivity dataset for California and Nevada, {USA} using all available data since mission launch (2000). Comparison of the two seasonal datasets indicates the greatest variability occurs in areas affected by snow such as the Sierra Nevada Mountains, and in agricultural regions. Comparisons of the new emissivity dataset with laboratory measurements of geologic samples show emissivity differences of less than 0.5\%, while 1â€“3\% differences were found for water and vegetation using spectra from the {MODIS} {UCSB} library.},
