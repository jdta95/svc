\subsection{The Model}
\label{sec:model}

Let $s_i \in \bbR^2$ for each $i = 1, \dots, n$ denote a spatial location for which we have collected data, and $\bs = (s_1, \dots, s_n)^\top$ be the vector of all such locations. Then $Y(\bs)$ are univariate dependent variables and $\bX(\bs) = (X_1(\bs), \dots, X_p(\bs))^\top$ are $p \times 1$ vectors of covariates. A linear regression model with spatially varying coefficients assumes $Y(\bs)$ are dependent on $\bX(\bs)$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
    Y(\bs) = \sum_{j=1}^p X_r(\bs)w_r(\bs) + w_0(\bs) + \epsilon(\bs),
\end{align*}
where $w_r(\bs)$ are the regression coefficients corresponding to $X_r(\bs)$, $w_0(\bs)$ are spatial random effects, and $\epsilon(\bs)$ are independently and identically distributed multivariate normal (MVN) measurement errors, i.e.
\begin{align*}
    \epsilon(\bs) \sim \text{MVN}(0, \tau^2 I_n).
\end{align*}
For convenience, we will treat $w_0(\bs)$ as the regression coefficients corresponding to $X_0(\bs) = \mathbf{1}_n$, a vector of length $n$ with every element equal to $1$.

For each $w_r(\bs)$, we assign a Gaussian process (GP) prior with squared exponential covariance, i.e.
\begin{align*}
    w_r &\sim \text{GP}(0, C(s, s')), \text{ where}\\
    C(s, s') &= \sigma_r^2\exp{\phi_r^{-1}\|s-s'\|^2}.
\end{align*}
We refer to $C(\cdot, \cdot)$ as the covariance function, which calculates the covariance between two locations $s$ and $s'$. Squared exponential covariance is a commonly used covariance function due to useful properties such as infinite smoothness and gradual decrease in covariance with distance. The parameter $\sigma_r^2$ is the spatial variance and $\phi_r$ is the spatial decay, which indicates how quickly correlation decreases with the squared distance.

We assign inverse-gamma conjugate priors for the variance parameters $\tau^2$ and each $\sigma_r^2$. In addition, each $phi_r$ is assigned a uniform prior. In summary,
\begin{align*}
    & \tau^2 \sim \text{Inv.Gamma}(\alpha_\tau, \beta_\tau),\\
    & \sigma_r^2 \sim \text{Inv.Gamma}(\alpha_r, \beta_r), \text{ and}\\
    & \phi_r \sim \text{Uniform}(l_r, u_r).
\end{align*}
